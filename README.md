# Self Learning Python
I am using the textbook "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes, published by [no starch press](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) to learn the basics and fine points of coding with Python.
I will be reading through the chapters and practicing some of the exercieses provided throughout the textbook.

 **Motivation:** Python is a common and powerful language, being able to code with it is a valuable skill to have. Additionally, *many* of my classes will require projects written in Python, so I am taking the iniative to learn it early before my lack of knowledge would become a problem.
